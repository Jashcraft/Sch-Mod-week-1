Value 1: 
    Autonomy    
        For most of my life I have lived in such a way that requires 
        other people to survive. I want to put myself in a position to 
        excel and succeed on my own with as much buffer room as 
        possible to reduce the stress of living paycheck to paycheck

Value 2: 
    Growth 
        Having lived primarily in situations that were consumed entirely 
        by figuring out how to make enough money to get by, I'd like to 
        grow into a position where I can save and take time off to enjoy 
        things.
